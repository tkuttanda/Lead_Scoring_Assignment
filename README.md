# Problem Statement
An education company named X Education sells online courses to industry professionals. The company markets its courses on various platforms also X Education gets leads through past referrals. The typical lead conversion rate at X education is around 30% although X Education gets a lot of leads, its lead conversion rate is very poor. The company has appointed us help them in selecting the most promising leads, i.e. the leads that are most likely to convert into paying customers. The company requires us to build a model wherein we need to assign a lead score to each of the leads such that the customers with a higher lead score have a higher conversion chance and the customers with a lower lead score have a lower conversion chance. The CEO has given a ballpark of the target lead conversion rate to be around 80%.

# Goals of the Case Study
There are few goals for this case study:
Build a logistic regression model to assign a lead score between 0 and 100 to each of the leads which can be used by the company to target potential leads. A higher score would mean that the lead is hot, i.e. is most likely to convert whereas a lower score would mean that the lead is cold and will mostly not get converted.
There are some more problems presented by the company which the model should be able to adjust to if the company's requirement changes in the future.
